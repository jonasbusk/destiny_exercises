    "In each exercise we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the code and think about the results. You are also encouraged to experiment with modifying the code and changing different input values to see how they affect the output. You can also refer to the documentation of the packages we use for additional information. You will likely learn much more this way than if you just run the code and read the instructions."
