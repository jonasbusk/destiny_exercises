# Exercises on basic machine learning

These exercises on basic machine learning were prepared for the DESTINY Training
School on "AI applied to Energy Storage" December 2023 by Jonas Busk (jbusk@dtu.dk).

The exercises are provided as a series of Python notebooks.
An introduction to the exercises is given in the first notebook `notebooks/1_introduction.ipynb`.
Some basic understanding of Python programming is assumed.

The easiest way to get started with the exercises is to open them using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), but you can also download and run them locally if you prefer.
